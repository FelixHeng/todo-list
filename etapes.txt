1) TodoApp.js : manage the state of all the todos
- TodoApp
    -TodoForm
    -TodoList
        -TodoItem

every todo need to have an : id, task & completed
we write an initialTodos, and pass it in the useState(initialTodos)
- we start by just rendering the <TodoList todos={todos} />
we pass in todos that we have in useState

2) make a TodoList.js component
